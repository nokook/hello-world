# hello-world
This is a time honored value and ritual to create a hello world repository.
I enjoy knowledge. Knowledge leads to power and it helps me chill and not freak out over things and realize danger and risk. Programming enables knowledge through creation and failure and errors and fixing errors. This makes me happy to be able to program, but I know it's not about code. It's about what the code does and that is why we do it.
